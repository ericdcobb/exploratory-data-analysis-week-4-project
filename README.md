# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Cleanup

The purpose of this project is to clean data about human activity as recorded by smartphone provided by the UCI machine Learning Repository. To learn more about the original data set, go [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). To learn more about the processing, check the codebook. 

This project assumes you have downloaded and unzipped the test data to the directory in which you will run the script. The data can be found here:

Move that zip file to the same directory as the provided R script (run_analysis.R). Unzip the file, and then execute the R script. The script will process the data and create a file named "tidy.txt". Check the codebook for information about what data is included in "tidy.txt" and how it was derived.
