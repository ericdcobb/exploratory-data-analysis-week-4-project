# exploratory-data-analysis-week-4-project

This project assumes you have downloaded and unzipped the test data to the directory in which you will run the script. The data can be found here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Move that zip file to the same directory as the provided R script (run_analysis.R). Unzip the file, and then execute the R script. The script will process the data and create a file named "tidy.txt". Check the codebook for information about what data is included in "tidy.txt" and how it was derived.
