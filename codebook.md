The goal of this data set is to take the raw data found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) (which record human activity data with smart phones) and tidy it to a certain degree. The updated data is moved into a file called: "tidy.txt" file. 

From the original experiement:

> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

In order to tidy the data, the following steps have been performed:

1. The original data is spread accross multiple files, it has been moved to a single file.
2. Any data point that is not an "average" or "standard deviation" has been removed.
3. The data has been associated with the correct subject.
4. The activity has been giving the correct label.
5. Every data point has been averaged per subject & activity.
